### New Note Diagram
In the app found at the url https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes, the notes function works by having a text field and a button.

When the button is pressed, the website reads whatever input is in the text field, sends it to some sort of database, and refreshes the website

When the website is refreshed, it reads from the database and displays all the previous notes plus the new note that was just created
