# (notes to self)
create a new project: npm create vite@latest projectname -- --template react

when starting new project, need to do npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev

initialize a npm project with npm init

with just javascript, an application can only communicate with a server in the same origin (its like a security thing). Cross origin communcation can be achieved by importing cors to a server with a seperate origin, 

cross-env allows for all operating systems to assign the NODE_ENV variable within package.json
